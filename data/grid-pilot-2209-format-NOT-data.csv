Consent to Participate in Human Subjects ResearchTitle: Measuring Statistics Attitudes with Grid Items: Pilot Study in MATH 2209Description of the Study: You are invited to participate in this research study being conducted by Dr. Douglas Whitaker of the Department of Mathematics. He is studying the use of a new type of survey item (using a grid response) and the relationship among existing scales used to measure the attitudes of students enrolled in statistics courses. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the way that attitudes related to statistics are measured. Conditions of Participation: You have been invited to participate in this study because you are currently enrolled in MATH 2209: Introduction to Statistics II at Mount Saint Vincent University. Participants must be at least 19 years of age. Participation is voluntary, and you may discontinue participation at any time during the survey. There is no compensation for participation. There is NO penalty for not participating or discontinuing your participation. Survey responses will be anonymous. Nobody, including the researcher or your instructor, will be able to determine who did or did not participate. Study Procedures: If you decide to participate in this study, you will be presented with a survey beginning on the next page. This survey will ask you questions about your attitudes about statistics and learning statistics. No identifying information will be collected – the survey responses will be anonymous. You may skip any question you do not wish to answer. Due to the anonymous nature of the survey, once your responses have been submitted you will not be able to withdraw your data from the study. Completing the survey should take less than 15 minutes. Potential Benefits and Risks: There are no risks for your participation in this research beyond the risks associated with everyday life. There are no direct benefits to you for your participation in this research. Data Storage and Future Use: Because no identifying information will be collected, the responses are anonymous and cannot be linked with your identity. During this study, the data will be stored on password-protected computers and servers affiliated with Mount Saint Vincent University. After research project that this survey is part of has concluded, the anonymous survey responses will be made publicly available so that other researchers can study them. Any text comments that you make will NOT be included in any public release – only the numeric responses recorded will be shared. These responses are anonymous and cannot be linked to you in any way. Contact: If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to contact Dr. Douglas Whitaker at 902-457-6654 or by email at douglas.whitaker@msvu.ca. This project has been reviewed and received clearance from the Research Ethics Board of Mount Saint Vincent University and conforms to the standards of the Canadian Tri-Council Research Ethics guidelines. If you have any questions about this process or to speak with someone about your rights as a participant in this study, please contact the Research Ethics Coordinator, Brenda Gagne, at 902-457-6350 or by email at brenda.gagne@msvu.ca.

Note that you may stop participating at any time or skip items, particularly if you feel uncomfortable or experience discomfort while taking this survey.","GridInstructPage1. Instructions: These items all use a grid to record your responses. Using the grid, you will be able to record the extent to which you agree and the extent to which you disagree with each statement. Please select the ONE box that best describes your OVERALL feeling about each statement.  Example 1: Taylor is responding to the item “I like eating kale.” Taylor really dislikes the taste of kale, but also knows that kale has a lot of nutrients. Taylor chooses the box that corresponds to “Greatly disagree” (because Taylor does not like the taste) and “Moderately agree” (because Taylor appreciates the nutritional value of kale). The highlighting represents Taylor’s thinking – there will be no highlighting on the survey. Taylor selects the box in the corresponding row and column. Example 2: Drew is responding to the item “I dislike driving in Halifax.” Drew really hates the traffic during rush hour, but also finds driving to be more convenient than other transportation options. Drew chooses the box that corresponds to “Completely agree” (because Drew hates driving in heavy traffic) and “Moderately disagree” (because Drew appreciates the convenience driving). The highlighting represents Drew’s thinking – there will be no highlighting on the survey. Drew selects the box in the corresponding row and column.","Page2Grid1[Y1_X1]. 1.

Please select the ONE box that best describes your OVERALL feeling about each statement.  Example 1: Taylor is responding to the item “I like eating kale.” Taylor really dislikes the taste of kale, but also knows that kale has a lot of nutrients. Taylor chooses the box that corresponds to “Greatly disagree” (because Taylor does not like the taste) and “Moderately agree” (because Taylor appreciates the nutritional value of kale). The highlighting represents Taylor’s thinking – there will be no highlighting on the survey. Taylor selects the box in the corresponding row and column. Example 2: Drew is responding to the item “I dislike driving in Halifax.” Drew really hates the traffic during rush hour, but also finds driving to be more convenient than other transportation options. Drew chooses the box that corresponds to “Completely agree” (because Drew hates driving in heavy traffic) and “Moderately disagree” (because Drew appreciates the convenience driving). The highlighting represents Drew’s thinking – there will be no highlighting on the survey. Drew selects the box in the corresponding row and column.","Page4Grid1[Y1_X1]. 1.
