# GridItemTools

## Installation

This package is not yet on CRAN; we aim to submit it to CRAN sometime in 2022. For now, install the latest version of the package by running this code:

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("douglaswhitaker/GridItemTools")
```

If you do not have the devtools package, install it with `install.packages("devtools")` in the usual way.

## Example Usage

This package was written to support the analysis in the paper ["Measuring Opportunity Cost in Statistics Using Evaluative Space Grid Items"](https://jrsmte.com/index.php/jrmste/article/view/20). In time, the analysis that was used in that paper will be shared here. (The package was updated during the course of writing this paper, so there isn't a single version of a document that produced the paper, but in time vignettes will be created to highlight uses of this package.)
